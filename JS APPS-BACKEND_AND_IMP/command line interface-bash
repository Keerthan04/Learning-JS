Setting Up Your Command Line
The command line is a powerful tool used by developers to find, create, and manipulate files and folders. This short tutorial will walk you through the steps for setting up the command line application on your computer.

Command Line Interfaces (CLIs) come in many forms. The CLI we’ll use is called Bash.

What is Bash?
Bash, or the __B__ourne-__A__gain __SH__ell, is a CLI that was created over twenty-seven years ago by Brian Fox as a free software replacement for the Bourne Shell. A shell is a specific kind of CLI. Bash is “open source” which means that anyone can read the code and suggest changes. Since its beginning, it has been supported by a large community of engineers who have worked to make it an incredible tool. Bash is the default shell for Linux and Mac. For these reasons, Bash is the most used and widely distributed shell. If you want to learn more about Bash, this Wikipedia article is a good place to start.

Try it out!
Now that you have your Command Line Interface open on your desktop, you are ready to use it. Go ahead and try some of the commands on your personal computer. Here are some good commands for practice:

ls to list the contents of the current directory. It may look something like this:

Explain
$ ls
Applications                Pictures
Codecademy                Public
Desktop                     Downloads
Documents                   Library

mkdir test to make a new directory named test. Now, when you type ls you should see a folder called test:

Explain
$ ls
Applications                Pictures
Codecademy                Public
Desktop                     Downloads
Documents                   Library
test

cd test to navigate into the new directory. You won’t see an output when you do this.
echo "Hello Command Line" >> hello_cli.txt to create a new file named hello_cli.txt and add Hello Command Line to that file. When you type ls, you should see the following:
$ ls
hello_cli.txt

cat hello_cli.txt to print the contents of the hello_cli.txt file to the terminal. You should see something like:
$ cat hello_cli.txt
Hello Command Line
